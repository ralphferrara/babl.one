# @babl.one/core

> Minimalist bootstrap kernel for the **babl.one** backend framework.

---

## Overview

`@babl.one/core` is the foundation of the babl.one backend architecture — a lean, opinionated bootstrap module designed to power a modular, composable, and blazing-fast TypeScript framework.

It provides the runtime shell and system initializer — everything else is a package.

## Philosophy

- **Minimal Core** — start with nothing, add only what you need
- **Fully Modular** — designed to load packages dynamically
- **Hot Reloads** - develop in record time

## Installation
